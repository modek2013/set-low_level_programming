# 0x02. C - Functions and Nested Loops

## 📖 About This Project
This project introduces **functions** and **nested loops** in C programming. 
Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks, while nested loops 
enable complex iterations (like loops inside loops). Together, they form the 
foundation of structured programming.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
After completing this project, I will be able to:
- Understand what functions are and how to use them
- Understand what nested loops are and why they're useful
- Declare and define functions with proper prototypes
- Use `_putchar` for character output (instead of printf/puts)
- Create header files with function prototypes
- Follow Betty coding style consistently

## 📋 Project Requirements
- All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

text
- All files must end with a new line
- Code follows Betty style (`betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`)
- No global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Only `_putchar` is allowed for output (no printf, puts)
- All function prototypes in `main.h`
