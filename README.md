# Low-Level Programming

This repository contains projects and tasks focused on low-level programming concepts using the C programming language. The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in how programs work at a lower level, including compilation, memory management, and interaction with the operating system.

## Environment

* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc
* Compilation flags:
  `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

## Project Structure

### 0x00-hello_world

Introduction to C programming and the compilation process:

* Understanding the compilation stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking)
* Writing and running basic C programs
* Using shell scripts to automate compilation steps

## Requirements

* All files end with a new line
* No global variables
* Maximum of 5 functions per file
* Follow Betty coding style for C files
* Shell scripts must:

  * Start with `#!/bin/bash`
  * Be exactly two lines long (where required)
  * Be executable
